commands
---------------
mkdir data -----create a directory in host , bind this directory to your conatiner so what ever the changes that yopu are making that will refelect in host directory aswell inside the container also
if the container deleted also..the data will persist in host directory
docker build -t binddemo .
docker run -d --name bindcontainer -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data binddemo

note:
Named volumes are easy to manage and reference.
Anonymous volumes are created automatically but harder to manage.
Bind mounts link directly to a host directory, useful for development
shared volumes are going to share for multiple containers
